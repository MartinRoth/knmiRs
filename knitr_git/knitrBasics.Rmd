## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, include=FALSE}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

```{r CachingOrNot, cache=TRUE}
Sys.sleep(5)
print("I waited for so long")
```

### Bash
```{r test-bash, engine='bash'}
ls ~ | grep ^D
```

### Python
Use the chunk option `engine='python'`:

```{r test-python, engine='python'}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x)
print(x.split(' '))
```

Or use the syntax ```` ```{python} ````:

```{python}
x = 'hello, python world!'
print(x.split(' '))
```


```{r FirstSimulate, cache=TRUE}
x <- rnorm(100000)
```

```{r Differentx}
x <- 5
```

```{r ThenAverage, cache = TRUE, dependson='FirstSimulate'}
mean(x)
```
